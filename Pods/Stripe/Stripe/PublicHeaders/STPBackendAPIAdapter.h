/**
 A "bridge" from our pre-built UI (`STPPaymentContext`, `STPPaymentOptionsViewController`)
 to your backend to fetch Customer-related information needed to power those views.
 
 Typically, you will not need to implement this protocol yourself. You
 should instead use `STPCustomerContext`, which implements <STPBackendAPIAdapter>
 and manages retrieving and updating a Stripe customer for you.
 @see STPCustomerContext.h

 If you would prefer retrieving and updating your Stripe customer object via
 your own backend instead of using `STPCustomerContext`, you should make your 
 application's API client conform to this interface.

 the raw JSON response from the Stripe API. Back in your iOS app, after you've
